You have to understand your own personal DNA. Don’t do things because I do them or Steve Jobs or Mark Cuban tried it. You need to know your personal brand and stay true to it.

Regardless of what you're trying to accomplish you've got to tell the world about it.
Skills are cheap. Passion is priceless.

No matter what you do, your job is to tell your story.

Look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself, what do I want to do every day for the rest of my life…do that.

Trust is on the rise because transparency is on the rise

99% of what we deal every day in business doesn’t matter. If you religiously follow the few core business philosophies that mean the most to you, everything else will naturally fall into place.

If you fail and people laugh at you, they’re not worth your time. Ignore them.

Cash is oxygen. You can make the greatest cup of coffee, the greatest sneaker, the greatest TV show, or the greatest work of art ever, but if you can’t sell your product you are out of business.

What’s the ROI of a piano? To me, it’s zero. For Billy Joel and Elton John, it has been substantial.

It’s easy to dream about it … Much harder to
How do you make people buy in? You don’t. I speak only to the converted, and you should do the same.

Retention is the game. The game in business is not how many customers you can get, it’s how many you can keep.

The game for me is not acquisition, it’s lifetime value and the percentage of wallet I get from that person.

Provide 51% of the value in a relationship, whether it’s with an employee, a client, or a stranger.

You can't live your life based on other people's point of view. I am tired of people not starting and living their life on one very simple thing which is they're worried about what other people think.
Smart work will never replace hard work, it only supplements it.

People are your most important commodity.

Never be romantic about how you make your money.

If your work is great, that becomes your reputation, and that becomes the gateway drug to bring business into your sales funnel.

The truth is that finding happiness in what you do every day is so imperative.

You didn’t grow up driving…you figured it out.

There is never a bad time to start a business – unless you want to start a mediocre one.

Time – the one asset none of us are ever gonna get more of.

All your ideas may be solid or even good. But you have to actually EXECUTE on them for them to matter.

Love your family, work super hard, live your passion.

I’m just always looking forwards. I spend very little time, looking backwards

Effort is grossly underrated.

You can market your ass off, but if your product sucks, you’re dead.

Legacy is greater than currency.

I hate how many people think glass half-empty when their glass is really four-fifths full. I’m grateful when I have one drop in the glass because I know exactly what to do with it.

If you live for the weekends and vacations, your shit is broken.

You need to spend all of your time and energy on creating something that actually brings value to the people you’re asking for money!

Stop whining, start hustling.

Know the philosophy, know the details, and ignore everything in the middle.

We only get to play this game one time…one life.

Whether you’re 9 or 90, stop trying to fix the things you’re bad at, and focus on the things you’re good at.

When it call comes down to it, nothing trumps execution.

Your legacy is being written by yourself. Make the right decisions.

A penguin cannot become a giraffe, so just be the best penguin you can be.

It’s easy to dream about it … Much harder to execute it ….Work!

Relationships are leverage. If you give value to someone else first, you have leverage.

Stop
I attract a crowd, not because I’m an extrovert or I’m over the top or I’m oozing with charisma. It’s because I care.

Word of mouth works now, much more than ever. @-reply every single person.

Brands mature over time, like a marriage. The bond you feel with your spouse is different than when you first met each other. Excitement and discovery are replaced by comfort and depth.

The reason I was able to grow my business was that every day, after producing 30 minutes of wine television, I spent 15 hours a day replying to every single person’s e-mail and every single person’s Twitter @ reply.

People are chasing cash, not happiness. When you chase money, you’re going to lose. You’re just going to. Even if you get the money, you’re not going to be happy.

There’s not a single winner on the earth that took it easy.
You can't be heard if you're not communicating.
Buy into positivity versus negativity. Blindly buy into positivity. Positivity leads to offense and results. It's the macro of it all.
Ultimately, a value exchange matters the most. No matter what, if you bring somebody value, if you make somebody laugh, if you make somebody think, if you deliver on your promise, that is always going to work out, no matter how you do that.

Can’t wait for Instagram to get rid of likes. Hoping it leads to the elimination of public vanity metrics. Really believe it will lead to an explosion of creativity and truth.

How can you give a fuck what people think when they don’t have the full picture? And more importantly, how can you judge someone when you don’t have the full picture?

Your dreams don’t have to be “big” they have to be yours.

Fuck everything.

Those who spit hate out there mouth are wildly broken inside, I’m not mad at them, I feel sorry as fuck for them

Give me kind as fuck and “B” skills over Complete asshole with “A+” skills. How you interact with the other boys and girls matters the most

Slow down the macro (you got time in life)…speed up the micro (get more done daily)

Be aggressively kind! If you are really happy inside – share that shit. Cause the angry are better at expressing it and it’s time we change that ❤️💛💙

Losing and winning both matter! Don't protect against them.

I suck at selling, I’m great I’m talking about the things I care about.

The ability to not care about anybody else’s opinions is the singular gateway to happiness

You don’t defeat hate with hate, you defeat hate with love at scale.

Being yourself is so much easier 😉 Who you trying to impress?

Stop judging yourself, so many beating themselves up, did you try as hard as you could? Did you have good intent? Good, you won.

Reputation is the ultimate currency

If you’re a CEO and your employees aren’t performing, that’s on you. Solving it comes down to 3 things:
Take the blame
Communicate better
Tell them they’re not executing at the level you’re hoping for. Then ask, “what can I do to help?”


Make happiness louder.

Your focus on hating yesterday is killing your opportunity to love tomorrow.

Sacrificing for what you want ✅ Suffering for what you want 🚫

Self awareness is ♥️ We all do it different! Be you!

Hoping today is a day you get an insight on yourself and it leads to more happiness.

If you’re not dreaming big for yourself, who’s doing it for you?

When you stay in your lane and speak about things you’ve lived and have done, it tends to work out

Supply and demand is undefeated.

Gratitude is the cure

People are better at creating ceiling for themselves than any outside force.

For me, happiness is doing what you want to do at all times.

If you’re so happy, then start putting happiness out into the universe.

You don’t have to eliminate negative family, you have to limit it.

31. Happiness over flashiness – stop the confusion.

 There are people here that work more on upgrading their phones than upgrading their minds.

I genuinely like people, have compassion and understanding when things don’t go well with them! Love and adore their capacity and the overall warmth and good we have in the world. Perspective is a powerful thing. If you see this, thank you 💙

People aren’t willing to sacrifice for what they want

Kindness is karma

Moving is important because you can change the course.

Anger and retaliation is never the reaction to venom. Never.

Practice positive perspective: 3P’s.

I like the game of thinking, whether it’s winning or losing.

People want to succeed so fast because they want to prove something to somebody else. That's what makes them vulnerable.

By the age of 7, 80% of my activities outside were business.

I’m such an animal of the market, that’s what makes me so adaptable.

I'm never comfortable because I know that yesterday is vulnerable tomorrow.

Don’t judge the end of the first quarter.

I don’t want your money, I want your admiration.

A lot of you are looking for the next step, when the next step is what got you there in the first place.

If you’re good enough, no one is stopping you.

You can’t beat what you copy.

Kids… want to be happy? Get off your parents payroll, the quicker they stop paying for stuff, the sooner they have no “say”

You find what you’re looking for.

Everyone is trying to prove something with final results or showing they bought something.

If you tell everyone you’re going to do something and you change your mind 100 days in, that’s a strength not a weakness.

You either want to become the “magazine” or the person they put on the front of the “magazine.”

Gratitude > cynicism is clearly the framework lacking for many.
I lack entitlement. It’s my strength.

Something that happened yesterday, has nothing to do with tomorrow.

Too many people “want things” but aren’t willing to take a step backwards and pay the price associated with their ambition. They lack the humility and patience for happiness and success.
Want to prove something? Prove that you are enjoying the process of figuring yourself out and chasing your current ambitions and curiosities.

You don’t want what your friends want, so why the fuck would you care?

You can’t read about pushups. What makes you think reading inspirational quotes all day is gonna get you “there”.

If you 100% enjoy the chaos and the unknown, you’re an entrepreneur.

The biggest asset in the world is your mindset

Every parent is judging their kids based on yesterday, but your kids are living in today, which is a better indicator of tomorrow

You fucked up. They’re 49% of the equation, you are 51.

If you think about business like a computer, culture is the operating system. Everything else is an “app.” Finance is an app. Creative is an app. Strategy is an app. But culture is the operating system.

Instead of “burnout” let’s call it “I changed my mind.”
When you find something you like and you’re good at it, life is a lot better than when you only chase money or dwell that the system is against you.

Makes me actually laugh how many people think kindness is a weakness… its the ultimate strength.

It makes no sense why people think that at 18, 22, 30, that they have to have their life figured out when “figuring everything out” is a forever game.

Kindness is such a signature of the strong.
No matter where you start, how you finish is on you.

Nobody owes you shit.

Looking backwards fucks with your neck.

Life is more like boxing. Just win today's fight.
Shit changes …. get used to it.

Don’t waste energy. Focus on what you control. Not what you wish you controlled.

Wanna be happy? Have zero expectations of others.

The quotes are simple. The execution is hard.
It’s possible. The question is are you hungry enough and willing to fucking eat shit, or are you soft?

Google is your mother.

I don’t want the money, I want the freedom.

If you live for weekends and vacations, your shit is broken.

GaryVee quotes -- You're not lost, you're just early in the process.
 You’re not lost. You’re just early in the process.
My lack of education allows me to keep things very simple. But simple is what plays out.

You’re not entitled to your dreams

More kindness, less judgment.
The Internet doesn’t care that you’re not interested in learning. It will continue to evolve without you.
When you’re a CEO or an executive, your job is to make decisions. Not sit in a conference room for an hour and 43 minutes to make a judgement call that could’ve been made in 17 minutes.

Nothing great should be easy.
Don’t waste energy … focus on what you control, not what you wish you controlled.
